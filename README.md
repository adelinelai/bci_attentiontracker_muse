This code allows you to measure your attention levels by tracking your Theta and Beta waves to calculate the Theta/Beta ratio. Once the Theta/Beta ratio is over your set number (which you determine with experimentation), the program sends you a notification reminding you to focus and tells you how long you've focused for. 

This code uses BlueMuse to manage neural recordings from Muse S.
